# Beep App üöñ

## üìö Introduction

This is the monorepo for the Beep App. Ride beep app is currently a substitute for the facebook page that people use to get around Boone, NC. This app allows college students to make money by beeping and allows for an easy and cheap way to get where they want around campus and Boone. The owners are students at App State, Ian Murphy and Banks Nussman, who saw the flaws of the facebook page and wanted to improve the experience with leaving everything that was great about the original idea.

### Provide envrionment data

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For develpment envrionment to start successfully, you must provide these envrionment varibles

```
POSTGRESQL_USER
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
POSTGRESQL_URL
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
REDIS_HOST
REDIS_PASSWORD
MAIL_HOST
MAIL_PORT
MAIL_USER
MAIL_PASSWORD
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID

Here is an example of my .zshenv

```shell
export MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
export MAIL_PORT=465
export MAIL_USER=banks@nussman.us
export MAIL_PASSWORD=<a real password here>

export S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<from Linode>
export S3_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=<from Linode>
export S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com

export POSTGRESQL_USER=beep
export POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<a real password here>
export POSTGRESQL_URL=postgresql://postgresql.nussman.us:5432

S3_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=hwgyeeurkgufgkerbvyrue
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com
GOOGLE_API_KEYS="["jgfhwgqjkfgwegjfgwekfegy","ghejfqwuguyiqfgvuyvu"]"
```
