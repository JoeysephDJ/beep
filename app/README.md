In Boone, many years ago, students started a system called "Beeping" as a Facebook group that allows them to make posts to find rides with other students. This Facebook page has been run and administered for years but a small team and I took on the task of making a native app that is intended to replace the Facebook page system of finding rides in Boone. Our goal with this app is to replace this inefficient Facebook system and streamline ride-sharing in small college towns. You can consider this app an Uber clone, but with a more niche audience and feature set.
